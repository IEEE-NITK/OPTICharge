## Introduction
Objective is to optimize the operation of a battery system using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance performance, efficiency, and longevity.

## Objectives
*Develop a Generalized BMS Environment: Ensure compatibility with various RL algorithms.
*Implement & Evaluate RL Algorithms: Deploy DQN, A2C and PPO on the developed environment.
*Performance Comparison: Investigate each algorithm’s capability in balancing SOC and temperature.
*Optimization: Fine-tune the most promising algorithm(s) for enhanced performance.

## Literature Survey
*Prevailing PPO Application: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a dominant choice for SOC and temperature management in Battery Management Systems (BMS) using Reinforcement Learning (RL).
*Alternate RL Algorithms: Other RL algorithms like DQN and A2C have demonstrated potential in diverse control scenarios, suggesting potential applicability in BMS.
*Research Gap in EV Context: Existing literature lacks dedicated, comparative studies of these algorithms within the context of BMS specifically tailored for Electric Vehicles (EVs), a domain demanding high reliability, safety, and energy efficiency.
*Objective of OptiCharge: This project aims to bridge this gap, offering a comprehensive evaluation of these RL algorithms for BMS in EV applications, providing crucial insights for the EV industry's future R&D initiatives.
